1. Python version
- Use python 3
- Tested with python 3.5.2 version

2. Packages
- Install python packages:

pip3 install nltk
pip3 install gensim
pip3 install git+git://github.com/gsi-upm/sematch.git
pip3 install cython
pip install dill

- NOTE: sematch has to be installed from github, since otherwise you will get python2 version of the package (AKA the wrong one). We need python3 version.


3. How to run?
- Run "main.py"
- It will run all the tests and print the results.
- Alternatively you can use python3 to run files:
    "Ngram_Similarity.py"
    "Semantic_Similarity.py"
    "Syntactic_Similarity.py"
