- Tested with python 3.5.2 version

2. Packages
- Install python packages:

pip3 install nltk
pip3 install gensim
pip3 install git+git://github.com/gsi-upm/sematch.git
pip3 install cython

- NOTE: sematch has to be installed from github, since otherwise you will get python2 version of the package (AKA the wrong one). We need python3 version.
